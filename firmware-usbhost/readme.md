# firmware-usbhost

The project of a vending robot operating in the state machine mode. Takes full control over interaction with payment systems through cashless payment terminals, management of the MDB/EXECUTIVE bus, fiscalization and telemetry for ERPs. Fully managed via http from user profile. The project is terribly commercial and will work strictly on a certain hardware. This project is for demonstration and will not be able to get ready to work.
